# e-commerce

Project Overview:
In this project, I spearheaded the development of an e-commerce website <br/>
aimed at providing a seamless shopping experience for users across various<br/>
product categories. Leveraging React.js, HTML, and CSS, I focused on creating<br/>
intuitive user interfaces and implementing essential features such as product display,<br/>
cart management, and checkout functionality.

<br/><br/>

Responsive UI Development:<br/>
Designed and developed responsive user interfaces for Men's, Women's,  Kids' and Cart' sections of the website.<br/>
Ensured compatibility and optimal viewing experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.<br/>
<br/> <br/>

Product Display and Interaction:<br/>
Implemented product display pages with detailed descriptions and high-resolution images to enhance user engagement.<br/>
Enabled users to easily browse products, view details, and add items to their shopping cart with intuitive click interactions.<br/>

<br/><br/>


Shopping Cart Functionality:<br/>
Integrated 'Add to Cart' functionality, allowing users to add desired items to their shopping cart for purchase.<br/>
Developed a dynamic shopping cart feature that displays the total amount payable and allows users to manage their selections.<br/>
